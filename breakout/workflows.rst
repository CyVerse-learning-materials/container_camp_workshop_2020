Workflow Management Using Snakemake
===================================

|snakemake|

In this breakout session you'll learn about `snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, a workflow management system consisting of a text-based workflow specification language and a scalable execution environment. You will be introduced to the Snakemake workflow definition language and how to use the execution environment to scale workflows to compute servers and clusters while adapting to hardware specific constraints. 

Snakemake is designed specifically for computationally intensive and/or complex data analysis pipelines. The name is a reference to the programming language Python, which forms the basis for the Snakemake syntax.

**Training session in Docker**
==============================

In these sessions we will cover various aspects of Docker containers for data science applications. Starting with the basics of pulling images from Docker Registries, running Docker containers locally and on cloud, and managing your data in a container using volumes. In the advanced session, you will modify an existing container by installing your own science libraries or packages.
